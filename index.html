	One particular part of this website that stood out to me was the fact that the background of the homepage of the site was a video that was playing. The video was really well shot. Although it took a minute to load, it didn't need to buffer after it loaded. I think this looks nice but might not be practical for people with slower internet connections or mobile viewers. Also, the pause bar at the bottom disappeared after a couple seconds and I couldn't get it back.

		One part about this website that I liked was the fact that the background color changed every time the website was loaded. I also liked the hover animation of the hexagon filling out. It is also a nice touch that the hexagon has a lowered opacity to let the background color through a little bit.

		What I like about this website is the clean and simple set up. The background is a nicely composed image. The menu is an easily recognizable symbol in the top right. When you scroll down some examples of his work appear. Also, when you first visit the site, the "web and graphic designer" and "get in touch" elements fade in after a second really nicely.
